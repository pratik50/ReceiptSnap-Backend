---

## 🚀 Features  
- 🔐 **Authentication** with JWT  
- 📂 **Secure File Uploads** (images, videos, PDFs) with **Presigned URLs**  
- ⚡ **Async File Processing** via **SQS + Lambda + Bedrock**  
- 🗄️ **PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM** for structured data storage  
- 🐳 **Containerized Deployment** with Docker + EC2  
- 🔄 **CI/CD Pipeline** using GitHub Actions + Docker Hub + EC2 Runner  
- 📊 **Monitoring & Logging** with CloudWatch  

## 🏗️ System Design  

Here’s the high-level architecture of **ReceiptSnap Backend**:

</p>

**Flow Highlights:**  
- Android app uploads receipts → API (Express + Node.js) → File Storage (S3).  
- Presigned URLs for secure uploads.  
- Processing via SQS → Lambda → Bedrock → Results stored back in DB + S3.  
- CI/CD pipeline automates build, push, and deployment via Docker.  
- CloudWatch monitors logs and health.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon) + Prisma ORM  
- **Storage:** AWS S3 (Raw Uploads, Processed)  
- **Queue & Processing:** AWS SQS, Lambda, Bedrock  
- **Deployment:** Docker, EC2, GitHub Actions CI/CD  
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch
